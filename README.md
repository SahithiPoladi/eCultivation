E-cultivation is an application which enhances the livelihood of farming communities in villages 
by providing personalized crop specific expertise to each farmer for their farms to yield a good crop. 
This application helps in the direct interaction between the farmer
and agricultural specialists. Here, the farmers are trained to capture the village farm
conditions and send the images directly to agricultural specialists through this application. On
a day to day basis farmers should capture the concerned farm conditions by taking pictures
and should fill the form in the application. As the whole process is taking place with an
application there should be an internet connection and after uploading the images as well as
the form farmer should click the submit button. The data which is sent by farmers is received
at nearby agricultural centre and the collected data is stored in the agricultural information
system. The agricultural experts present in the centre access the agricultural information
system and delivers the advice to the farmer through messages. Every agricultural specialist
is specialized in a certain area and based on the requirements the advice is given. The soil
fertility of the farm is checked whenever an advice is given and there would be a person
appointed for that job who is specialized in that area. The advice given by agricultural experts
may be in the form of image or a text. If the farm is attacked by a pest then agricultural
specialists even mention the quantity of pesticides or fertilizers to be sprayed so that the farm
doesn’t destroy and the pest attack is reduced. The farmers are advised by agricultural experts
on a daily basis and are benefited through this application. If farmer cannot do the
work, a village coordinator is appointed who will be helping farmers in growing their
crops without any damage.
